# website

This is an amazon clone website. I recreated home, login and sign-up pages. 
The static folder contains css file for each of the pages and a javascript file that is responsible for the image slider on the home page.
Template folder contains frontend code for each of the pages. 
Auth, views, models and __init__ are part of the backend.
